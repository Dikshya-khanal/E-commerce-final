        <p class="description">
            E-commerce can be classified into six main types, each with unique features and purposes. These categories define how businesses and consumers interact in the digital marketplace.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <!-- E-Commerce Types List -->
        <ol>
            <li>Business to Business (B2B)</li>
            <p>B2B e-commerce holds all electronic transactions of good or services conducted between companies. This only involves the manufacturers,wholesalers and retailers etc. <br> For instance, a business sells software-as-a-service for other businesses to use.</p>

            <li>Business to Consumer (B2C)</li>
            <p>B2C e-commerce refers to transactions in which a business sells its products or services to consumers. Business to consumer is the most common e-commerce model, and therefore, many online niches fall into this category. They often use digital marketing and advertisement for their e-commerce business success. 
              <br> Example of B2C includes buying clothes from online store like Zara,Daraz etc. </p>

            <li>Consumer to Consumer (C2C)</li>
            <p>Consumer to Consumer , where the consumers are in direct contact with each other. In this model, no company is involved. It helps people sell their personal goods and assets directly to an interested party. Usuallly, goods traded are cars, bikes , electronics etc. 
              <br> For example, sell the old furniture on eBay to another consumer. </p>

            <li>Consumer to Business (C2B)</li>
            <p>This is the reverse of B2C which is a consumer to business. So the consumer provides a good or some service to the company.C2B also includes influencer marketing, where individuals with a large following on social media can collaborate with businesses to promote products or services
              .<br> for example,an influencer offers exposure to their online audience in exchange for a fee, or a photographer licenses their photo for a business to use.</p>

            <li>Business to Administration (B2A)</li>
            <p> B2A is an e-commerce mode category that includes all transactions that take place on the internet between companies, public administration or government agencies. This includes many services, particularly in areas such as social security, employment and legal documents and provides an online service for companies, the public sector, the government , generally through a website. </p>

            <li>Consumer to Administration (C2A)</li>
            <p>Consumer-to-Administration (C2A) e-commerce model, consumers interact with the government or public administration to access certain services or information. It involves using digital platforms to enable citizens to interact with government services online.

                
                
              <br>   A common example of C2A is online tax filing systems, where people can file their taxes electronically instead of filling out paper forms and mailing them to the government. This saves time and effort for both the taxpayers and the government while reducing the potential for errors in the filing process. </p>
